/*
 *
 *
 * The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
 * 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
 *
 * This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below
 * one-hundred.
 *
 * The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a
 * prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
 *
 * Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most
 * consecutive primes?
 *

/*For this project, I'll need:
 *  -my prime number generator, (or at least just one million primes)
 *  -a prime factorization program
 *  -this program, which takes the output of the previous program and runs
 *  along.
